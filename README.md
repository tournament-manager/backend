## TOURNAMENT BACK-END

This tournament app is used to set up soccer tournaments. Each tournament is composed of a set of games, delineated by birth year and any other classification (gender, skill level), referred to here as divisions.  

The set-up for each division of a tournament has 16 teams, each competing as 4 groups of 4, playing against each team in their group.
- In this stage, points are awards to each game with the following rules: 6 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 1 point for each goal scored up to 3, and 1 point for a clean-sheet (no goals allowed).  The maximum points in a game in group play is 10.  
- From the groups, the two teams with the highest points move on to the play-offs.  The play-offs consist of single elimination games at the quarter-final, semi-final and final level.  
Once complete, each division will have completed 31 games.

## Application structure
The back-end of the application used a non-relational MongoDB database for data persistence.  It runs on NodeJS and uses the Express routing and middleware framework.

Testing is carried out using Jest.  Load testing was done using artillery.

All the additional dependencies are listed in the package.json file.  

The project uses Travis-CI for continuous integration and is deployed on Heroku at  https://tournament-back-end.herokuapp.com/.

### Models
Data is stored in this application using a non-relational database - MongoDB.  There are seven schemas.

*User-model* is the sign-up/sign-in model for authorized users.  The only two type of authorized users are tournament admins - linked to tournaments - and referees, linked to games. Email, full name, password and notification (boolean) are required. This model contains the functions for generating and comparing passwords via hash and generating tokens.

*Tournament-model* has only requires a name, and is linked to the user (admin).
*Division-model* is the next level and requires a name, ageGroup and classification.  It is associated with the tournament and links to the games.
*Game-model* requires a game number.  This model brings associates the teams, fields, referees and is linked to a division.

*Ref-model* requires only a name and contact and is used to update game scores.
*Field-model* requires a name, size and location.  Fields are assigned by the admin.
*Team-model* require the information necessary to define a team - name, coach, birthyear, classification and their associated tournaments.  


### LOAD TESTING
The load tests were conducted using Artillery from https://artillery.io/.   The load tests are contained in the __test__/loadtest folder.  Requests were made to the locally to test out code and to the Heroku backend (https://tournament-back-end.herokuapp.com/) to test the deployment.  
- Post requests were made to sign up users (user-model), receive a token and use the token to create a tournament (tournament-model) using the loadtest.json file.
- Get requests were made to view tournaments were made using the getloadtest.json.

Tests were conducted to find a level that could be sustained and an upper level that would cause failures is an effort to gauge the breaking point.

#### Localhost Testing
Post test - with a server started on a localhost port and a mongo db running, start the test on a localhost port from the command line entering *artillery run -e development __test__/loadtest/loadtest.json*.

Running a high load, but passing was achieved with the following set-up
```
"development": {
  "target": "http://localhost:3000",
  "phases": [
    {
      "duration": 2,
      "arrivalRate": 10
    },
    {
      "duration": 10,
      "arrivalRate": 400
    }
   ]
}
}
},
```
The results were:
```
All virtual users finished

Increasing the arrival rate to 500 crashes the mongo database.

Get test - using *artillery run -e development __test__/loadtest/getloadtest.json*

#### Production Testing
Post test - hitting a deployed backend with the command *artillery run -e production __test__/loadtest/loadtest.json* are the following settings
```
"production": {
  "target": "https://tournament-back-end.herokuapp.com",
  "phases": [
    {
      "duration": 2,
      "arrivalRate": 5
    },
    {
      "duration": 10,
      "arrivalRate": 50
    }
  ]
}
```
resulted in a few issues with accessing the data base
